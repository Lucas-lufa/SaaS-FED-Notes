## two
Topics Covered:

1. Learning terminologies via General, Network-Internet, Services, Web, and etc.

2. Recovering how to set up Laragon and PHPStorm update.

3. Basic syntax of PHP via PHPStorm and running on web server using Laragon.

Maybe it is just my way of life but all I am familiar with all the terminologies but once again I can see would be a very useful resource. Setting up Laragon with Jetbrains ide to update in a windows environment, for me my package manager takes care of it all. Seeing the basics of PHP shown was very enlightening, I have been learning PHP but seeing it shown helped my understanding on how it worked.

My struggles is self inflected, I want to use Linux so a LAMP stack. There are some docker project I have been looking at one is laradock. I will use the windows partition as an escape hatch if I can't get it working.

## one
I learnt bash mode on window, bash script and some new ideas on aliasing.
It is was fun to talk to others about using the command line. I have had contact with jetbrain products so setting up PHPstorm wasn't a problem for me but I could see how it would be helpful for others.

At this stage I had no struggles.
